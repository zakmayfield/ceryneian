# üëΩ Hello there, friend.

## Ôºü Why I created this project 

I found a very aestetic coffee shop website that I am going to attempt to re create in Remix, [Rooster Coffee House](https://roostercoffeehouse.com/). 

My intention for this app is to gain knowledge of Remix and other React server side frameworks by re creating a real world application which utilizes a custom database and user authentication.

**My goals for this build are as follows**: 
  * gain insight into `Remix` and how to effeciently build websites with it
  * possibly learn how to `create sessions` that store user information that can be used to authenticate my application
  * integrating BaaS tech into my app, such as `Supabase` or `Clerk`
  * understand best practices for file routing and useage of `SSR` and `CSR`.


## üîí Authentication & Database Strech Goals

### ÔºÅSessions | Clerk | Supabase

I struggle with authentication. Adding a `BaaS` to manage my auth/db via a service sounds appealing. This might lead me to using `Supabase` as my BaaS, I've heard a lot of good things about Supabase. The database would be relatively small, maybe a `user` auth table, `product` table, and `cart`/`orders` table. A few relations at most + authentication.

*Note that authentication is a stretch goal because i struggle with the implementation of it most of the time*
