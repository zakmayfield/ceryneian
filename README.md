## Authentication

### Sessions | Clerk

There are a couple of things i want to try with this project 

* Firstly I am going to `hand roll authentication` with `sessions` & `cookies` as the main way to  authenticate users of the app.
* As a `stretch goal`, I'm going to *attempt* and implement `Clerk.js` as the authentication system. I'm hoping this will allow me to gain knowledge of auth libraries.
