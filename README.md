# üëΩ Hello there, friend.

## Ôºü Why I created this project 

I found a very aestetic coffee shop website that I am going to attempt to re create in Remix, [Rooster Coffee House](https://roostercoffeehouse.com/). 

My intention for this app is to gain knowledge of Remix and other React server side frameworks by re creating a real world application which utilizes a custom database and user authentication.

**My goals for this build are as follows**: 
  * gain insight into `Remix` and how to effeciently build websites with it
  * learn how to `create sessions` that store user information that can be used to authenticate my application
  * understand best practices for file routing and useage of SSR and CSR.


## üîí Authentication Strech Goals

### ÔºÅSessions | Clerk

There are a couple of things i want to try with this project 

* Firstly I am going to `hand roll authentication` with `sessions` & `cookies` as the main way to  authenticate users of the app.
* As a `second stretch goal`, I'm going to *attempt* and implement `Clerk.js` as the authentication system. I'm hoping this will allow me to gain knowledge of auth libraries.

*Note that authentication is a stretch goal because i struggle with the implementation of it most of the time*
